When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working away from your main machine or on a client machine elsewhere.
When you are collaborating with a group of people on building code.
When you are wanting to share your code or other content with anyone

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repo?

Automatic updating might cause issues in your local repo. Best to review what's on github (since anyone can add/delete code), before choosing to pull changes through.
