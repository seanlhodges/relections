When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working away from your main machine or on a client machine elsewhere.
When you are collaborating with a group of people on building code.
When you are wanting to share your code or other content with anyone

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repo?

Automatic updating might cause issues in your local repo. Best to review what's on github (since anyone can add/delete code), before choosing to pull changes through.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: these are clones of branches between users on, and within, Github. Useful when you wish to build on another persons repo.
Clone: these are clones of branches using Git, with branches either in git or from GitHub. Useful to make changes that can be linked back to an origin.
Branches: these are a group of commits that together make up the history of the code development. Various tracks can be followed to develop new features or test changes, using branches, without affecting the master code.
